**Our Research Paper Link:** https://ijsrst.com/home/issue/view/article.php?id=IJSRST24111125

## Overview
This project aims to address the critical issue of counterfeit products in the manufacturing industry by utilizing blockchain technology. The system enhances trust by providing an unalterable, transparent, and decentralized solution for product authenticity verification, ensuring consumers can identify genuine products without needing third-party validation.

## Introduction
Counterfeit products are a major challenge in the manufacturing industry, leading to significant losses in revenue and reputation. This project presents a Fake Product Identification System that uses blockchain technology to verify the authenticity of products. By leveraging QR codes and the security features of blockchain, the system ensures that each productâ€™s authenticity can be easily verified by end-users.

## Features
-> **Decentralized Ledger:** Utilizes blockchain to store product data, ensuring that information is secure, transparent, and unalterable.

-> **QR Code Verification:** Generates a unique QR code for each product, based on a hash value, which can be scanned to verify authenticity.

-> **Counterfeit Detection:** Automatically detects counterfeit products by comparing scanned QR codes with blockchain records.\

-> **No Third-Party Involvement:** Empowers customers to verify product authenticity directly, eliminating the need for third-party verification services.

## Technologies Used
-> **Blockchain Technology:** For secure, decentralized, and transparent data storage.

-> **QR Code:** For easy product verification by consumers.

-> **Hashing Algorithms:** To generate unique identifiers for each product.

-> **Mobile and Wireless Technologies:** To facilitate QR code scanning and verification.
